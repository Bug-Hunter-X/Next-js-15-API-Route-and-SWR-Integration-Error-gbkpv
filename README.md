# Next.js 15 API Route and SWR Integration Error

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when integrating a Next.js 15 API route with the `swr` library.  The API route itself functions correctly but when used with SWR sometimes returns unexpected errors.

## Problem Description

Intermittently, fetching data from the API route using `useSWR` results in a 404 error or an empty response.  The API route consistently returns the expected data when tested directly, indicating the issue lies in the interaction between the API route and `useSWR`.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the behavior of the `MyComponent` on the homepage.  Note the intermittent failures to fetch data.

## Solution

A solution is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file which focuses on careful handling of the response and improved error handling.
